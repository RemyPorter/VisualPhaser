# Visual Phaser
This is a toy for experimenting with different approaches to having rotating circles create patterns by twiddling the phase of those circles. It's not really built with a front-end, but uses a builder API to make it easy to design things. There is not, as of yet, any real documentation.

Consider this code Public Domain.
